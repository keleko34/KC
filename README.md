###### Gulp Build Tool

* gulp create
** Simply running the gulp create command willl prompt you to enter a component name and will do all the initial component structure setup for you.

* gulp build
** gulp build will prompt you for which component you would like to build, build will automatically pull in all subfiles, convert the requirejs defines to standard self instantiated methods and package them into a debug build and a closure compiled minified version as well.
